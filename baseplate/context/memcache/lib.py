"""Memcache serialization/deserialization (and compression) helper methods.

Memcached can only store strings, so to store arbitrary objects we need to
serialize them to strings and be able to deserialize them back to their
original form.

New services should use dump_and_compress() and decompress_and_load().

Services that need to read and write to the same memcache instances as r2
should use pickle_and_compress() and decompress_and_unpickle().

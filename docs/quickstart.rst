Quick Start
===========

Baseplate has a project generation tool to help you get started.
Install it on your development machine::

   pip install git+https://github.com/reddit/baseplate-cookiecutter

Then run the tool and follow the prompts::

   baseplate-cookiecutter

The templates have liberal "TODO"s for you to fill in your application. Once
you're ready to start running some code, fire it up with the included Vagrant
or Docker files as described in your project's generated README file.
